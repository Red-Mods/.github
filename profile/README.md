Welcome to Red Mods organization !

## What is Red Mods ?
**Red Mods** is an organization made by [@K3rhos](https://github.com/K3rhos) and some other members of my team, the main purpose of this organization is to share resources & knowledge to other developers regarding game modding.
And of course, we encourage ppls to help us improving our repositories in return.

## Why this name 'Red Mods' ?
Initially Red Mods was intended to be related exclusively with **Red Dead Redemption**, but this has been extended to be around game modding in general. Especially on **Rockstar Games** titles.

However, **Red Dead Redemption** modding is still our priority right now and we've no plans for any other games right now.
